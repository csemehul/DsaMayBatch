It initializes a result vector res with dimensions (n-2) x (n-2) to store the results.

It iterates over the grid, excluding the first and last rows and columns (i from 1 to n - 2, and j from 1 to n - 2).

For each cell in the grid, it initializes temp to 0 and iterates over the 3x3 submatrix centered at the current cell (i, j), finding the maximum value within this submatrix.

After finding the maximum value within the 3x3 submatrix, it stores this value in the corresponding position of the result vector res.

Finally, it returns the result vector containing the maximum values from each local 3x3 submatrix.
