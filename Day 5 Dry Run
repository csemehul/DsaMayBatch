Dry-Run:
Lets dry run for the given example:

        2
       / \
      1   3
         / \
        0   1
Step 1: Evaluate the leaf nodes.

Node with value 1 evaluates to true.
Node with value 0 evaluates to false.
Node with value 1 evaluates to true.
Step 2: Evaluate the non-leaf node with value 3 (AND operation).

Left child (value 0) evaluates to false.
Right child (value 1) evaluates to true.
Perform AND operation: false AND true = false.
Step 3: Evaluate the root node with value 2 (OR operation).

Left child (value 1) evaluates to true.
Right child (value 3) evaluates to false (from Step 2).
Perform OR operation: true OR false = true.
Step 4: Return the final result.

The root node evaluates to true, so the output is true.
Thus, the output for the given binary tree is true.
