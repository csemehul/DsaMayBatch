Here's how the approach works:

We Iterate through the grid to find cells with gold.

For each cell with gold:

a. We perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from that cell.

b. We mark the cell as visited to avoid revisiting before exploring it.

c. Explore all four directions (up, down, left, right) from the current cell.

d. In each direction, if the next cell is valid (within bounds, unvisited, and has gold), recursively call DFS from that cell.

e. Keep track of the maximum gold collected in the current path.

f. After exploring all paths, unmark the starting cell as visited to allow revisiting from other starting points.

Update the overall maximum gold collected if the current path's gold is greater.

Return the overall maximum gold collected from any starting cell.

Some key points are:
DFS to explore all paths from each starting cell.
Marking cells as visited to avoid revisiting.
Backtracking to explore all possible paths.
Updating the maximum gold collected at each step.

//codes
defines a class Solution with a method getMaximumGold,
which calculates the maximum amount of gold that can be collected by a miner moving on a 2D grid. 
The algorithm used is a depth-first search (DFS) implemented recursively.

roww and coll are vectors representing the changes in the x and y coordinates, respectively, to move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
maxGold is a class member variable to store the maximum gold collected.
dfs is a recursive function that performs DFS to explore paths and calculate the maximum gold that can be collected starting from a given position (x, y) on the grid.
getMaximumGold is the main function that iterates over all cells in the grid, calls dfs for each cell, and updates maxGold with the maximum value returned by dfs.
