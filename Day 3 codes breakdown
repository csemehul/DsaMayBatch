defines a class Solution with a method getMaximumGold,
which calculates the maximum amount of gold that can be collected by a miner moving on a 2D grid. 
The algorithm used is a depth-first search (DFS) implemented recursively.

roww and coll are vectors representing the changes in the x and y coordinates, respectively, to move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
maxGold is a class member variable to store the maximum gold collected.
dfs is a recursive function that performs DFS to explore paths and calculate the maximum gold that can be collected starting from a given position (x, y) on the grid.
getMaximumGold is the main function that iterates over all cells in the grid, calls dfs for each cell, and updates maxGold with the maximum value returned by dfs.
