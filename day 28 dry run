dry run of the provided solution with an example.

 Example:
- `seats = [3, 1, 5, 4]`
- `students = [2, 7, 5, 1]`

 Step-by-Step Dry Run:

1. Initial Arrays:
   - `seats = [3, 1, 5, 4]`
   - `students = [2, 7, 5, 1]`

2. Sorting:
   - Sort `seats`: `seats = [1, 3, 4, 5]`
   - Sort `students`: `students = [1, 2, 5, 7]`

3. Calculate Moves:
   - Initialize `moves = 0`
   - Loop through the arrays and calculate the absolute differences:
     - For `i = 0`: `moves += abs(1 - 1) = 0` → `moves = 0`
     - For `i = 1`: `moves += abs(3 - 2) = 1` → `moves = 1`
     - For `i = 2`: `moves += abs(4 - 5) = 1` → `moves = 2`
     - For `i = 3`: `moves += abs(5 - 7) = 2` → `moves = 4`

4. Return Result:
   - The total number of moves is `4`.

 Summary:
- After sorting: `seats = [1, 3, 4, 5]` and `students = [1, 2, 5, 7]`.
- Moves calculation: `|1-1| + |3-2| + |4-5| + |5-7| = 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 4`.

Thus, the function correctly returns `4` as the minimum number of moves required to seat all students.
