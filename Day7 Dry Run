Consider the following binary tree: 
       3
      / \
     0   0
Initialization:

res is initialized to 0.
distributeCoins is called with the root node (value 3).
DFS on Root (value 3):

Call dfs(root). root is not null.
Call dfs(root->left) where root->left is the node with value 0.
DFS on Left Child (value 0):

Call dfs(root->left) where root->left is null. It returns 0.
Call dfs(root->right) where root->right is null. It returns 0.
left = 0, right = 0.
Calculate the moves: res += abs(left) + abs(right), so res += 0 + 0 which keeps res as 0.
Return root->val + left + right - 1 => 0 + 0 + 0 - 1 = -1.
DFS on Right Child (value 0):

Call dfs(root->left) where root->left is null. It returns 0.
Call dfs(root->right) where root->right is null. It returns 0.
left = 0, right = 0.
Calculate the moves: res += abs(left) + abs(right), so res += 0 + 0 which keeps res as 0.
Return root->val + left + right - 1 => 0 + 0 + 0 - 1 = -1.
Back to Root (value 3):

The left subtree returned -1.
The right subtree returned -1.
left = -1, right = -1.
Calculate the moves: res += abs(left) + abs(right), so res += 1 + 1 which updates res to 2.
Return root->val + left + right - 1 => 3 + (-1) + (-1) - 1 = 0.
Summary:
The total number of moves required (res) is 2.
Explanation of Moves:
Move one coin from the root (3) to the left child (0).
Move one coin from the root (2) to the right child (0).
After these moves, each node has exactly one coin, fulfilling the requirement. The code correctly computes the minimum number of moves required to distribute the coins in the binary tree.

Here is the final state of the tree after distributing coins:
       1
      / \
     1   1
