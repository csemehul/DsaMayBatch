Dry Run
Initialization:

result = 0
First Iteration (num = 1):

result |= 1 (Binary OR with 1)
result becomes 0001 (in binary), which is 1.
Second Iteration (num = 3):

result |= 3 (Binary OR with 3)
result becomes 0011 (in binary), which is 3.
Third Iteration (num = 5):

result |= 5 (Binary OR with 5)
result becomes 0111 (in binary), which is 7.
Final Calculation:

N = nums.size() = 3
Compute 1 << (N - 1): 1 << 2 = 4
Multiply the result: 7 * 4 = 28
Result
The sum of XORs of all subsets of {1, 3, 5} is 28.

Breakdown of Subsets for Verification
To verify the result, let's list all subsets and their XORs:

{}: XOR = 0
{1}: XOR = 1
{3}: XOR = 3
{5}: XOR = 5
{1, 3}: XOR = 1 ^ 3 = 2
{1, 5}: XOR = 1 ^ 5 = 4
{3, 5}: XOR = 3 ^ 5 = 6
{1, 3, 5}: XOR = 1 ^ 3 ^ 5 = 7
Sum of these XOR values: 0 + 1 + 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 7 = 28

The dry run and verification show that the optimized solution correctly computes the sum of XORs of all subsets.
