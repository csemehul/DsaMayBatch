int M = A.size(), int N = A[0].size(): These lines calculate the number of rows and columns in the matrix.
int res = (1 << (N - 1)) * M;: This line initializes the result res with the initial score of the matrix. (1 << (N - 1)) calculates 2^(N-1), which is the value of the first column for each row. This value is then multiplied by the number of rows M.
The outer loop for (int j = 1; j < N; j++) iterates over each column (starting from the second column).
Inside the outer loop, the inner loop for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) iterates over each row, and cur += A[i][j] == A[i][0]; counts the number of elements in the current column that are equal to the first element of the same row.
After counting, max(cur, M - cur) calculates the maximum count of 0s or 1s in the current column.
(1 << (N - j - 1)) calculates the value of the current column.
Finally, this value is multiplied by the maximum count of 0s or 1s in the column and added to the result res.
The function returns the final score res.
