Dry run of the given code with an example.

Example:
A = [3, 10, 5]
k = 2
edges is not used in this function, so we can ignore it for this dry run.
Initial State:
res = 0
d = 1 << 30 (which is 1073741824)
c = 0
Iteration 1:
a = 3
b = a ^ k = 3 ^ 2 = 1
max(a, b) = max(3, 1) = 3
res += 3 → res = 3
c ^= (a < b) = c ^= (3 < 1) = c ^= 0 = 0 (since 3 is not less than 1)
d = min(d, abs(a - b)) = min(1073741824, abs(3 - 1)) = min(1073741824, 2) = 2
Iteration 2:
a = 10
b = a ^ k = 10 ^ 2 = 8
max(a, b) = max(10, 8) = 10
res += 10 → res = 13
c ^= (a < b) = c ^= (10 < 8) = c ^= 0 = 0 (since 10 is not less than 8)
d = min(d, abs(a - b)) = min(2, abs(10 - 8)) = min(2, 2) = 2
Iteration 3:
a = 5
b = a ^ k = 5 ^ 2 = 7
max(a, b) = max(5, 7) = 7
res += 7 → res = 20
c ^= (a < b) = c ^= (5 < 7) = c ^= 1 = 1 (since 5 is less than 7)
d = min(d, abs(a - b)) = min(2, abs(5 - 7)) = min(2, 2) = 2
Final Calculation:
res = 20
d = 2
c = 1
res - d * c = 20 - 2 * 1 = 20 - 2 = 18
Result:
The function returns 18.
